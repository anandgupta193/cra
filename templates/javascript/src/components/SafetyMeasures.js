          Ayurveda’s immunity boosting measures for self care during COVID 19
          crisis
        </p>
        <p className="lead text-left">
          In the wake of the Covid 19 outbreak, entire mankind across the globe
          is suffering. Enhancing the body’s natural defence system (immunity)
          plays an important role in maintaining optimum health. We all know
          that prevention is better than cure. While there is no medicine for
          COVID-19 as of now, it will be good to take preventive measures which
          boost our immunity in these times. Ayurveda, being the science of
          life, propagates the gifts of nature in maintaining healthy and happy
          living. Ayurveda’s extensive knowledge base on preventive care derives
          from the concepts of “Dinacharya” - daily regimes and “Ritucharya” -
          seasonal regimes to maintain healthy life. It is a plant-based
          science. The simplicity of awareness about oneself and the harmony
          each individual can achieve by uplifting and maintaining his or her
          immunity is emphasized across Ayurveda’s classical scriptures.
          Ministry of AYUSH recommends the following self-care guidelines for
          preventive health measures and boosting immunity with special
          reference to respiratory health. These are supported by Ayurvedic
          literature and scientific publications.
